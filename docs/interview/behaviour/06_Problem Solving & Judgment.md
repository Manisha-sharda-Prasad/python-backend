### 1.Short-term sacrifice, long-term benefit/ cut corners to meet a deadline.:
- C - Decision-Making & Prioritization, Ethics 	
- T - Strategic thinking, Judgements, ownership, trade-off story with outcome, risk-awareness
- A - STAR format, risk → thought process → outcome →long-term impact,(benefits from sacrificing?) 	
- R - “I always do what’s fastest” 

### 2.Calculated Risk (System Perf /Space-Time /Speed):	
- Judgment under Uncertainty	
- Trade-offs, performance, scalability	
- Show technical thought process + metrics	
- Blind risk-taking without mitigation

### 3. Complex Problem /Logic /Simplify:	
- Problem Solving , 	
- Systems thinking, coding maturity	
- Break down big problem, explain simplification	
- Overcomplicating; vague logic

### 4. Deadline /Missed Plan	
- Time Management	
- Planning, resilience	
- Be transparent, describe corrective action	
- Making excuses, not showing improvement

### 5. Describe a technical challenge you overcame. 
- Technical Depth & Problem-Solving 
- Debugging, persistence 
- Explain challenge → steps taken → what made it tough → final result 
- Glossing over details 

### 6. What would you do if your team is blocking you? 
- Ownership & Communication 
- Problem-solving, communication 
- Attempt unblocking → raise appropriately → suggest alt plans 
- Complaining, escalation without ownership 

 ✅ Approach: “I’d try to clarify expectations or dependencies, offer help to unblock, 
and if still stuck, raise it in our stand-up or escalate respectfully with alternatives.”
