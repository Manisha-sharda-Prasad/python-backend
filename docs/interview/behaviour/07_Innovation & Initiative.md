### 1. Tell me about a time you solved a problem innovatively. 
- Innovation & Problem-Solving 
- Creativity, proactiveness 
- Unique solution → how it improved performance or process → impact 
- Too simple or routine task 
 ✅ Example: “I used a lightweight in-memory cache with TTL for a frequently accessed API, 
 cutting down latency by 60% with minimal infra change.” 

### 2. Time you went above and beyond for a client. 
- Customer Obsession & Initiative 
- Empathy, ownership 
- Anticipated need or solved hidden pain point → extra effort → result 
- Doing too much without permission, no clear result 

 ✅ Example: “I stayed late to debug an issue impacting a major client’s end-of-quarter release, resolved it, 
and wrote an RCA so it wouldn’t recur. The client thanked us directly to leadership.” |
