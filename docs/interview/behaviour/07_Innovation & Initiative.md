### 1. Tell me about a time you solved a problem innovatively:
- Innovation & Problem-Solving 
- Creativity, proactiveness 
- Unique solution → how it improved performance or process → impact 
- Too simple or routine task 
 ✅ Example: “I used a lightweight in-memory cache with TTL for a frequently accessed API, 
 cutting down latency by 60% with minimal infra change.” 

### 2. Time you went above and beyond for a client: 
- Customer Obsession & Initiative 
- Empathy, ownership 
- Anticipated need or solved hidden pain point → extra effort → result 
- Doing too much without permission, no clear result 

 ✅ Example: “I stayed late to debug an issue impacting a major client’s end-of-quarter release, resolved it, 
and wrote an RCA so it wouldn’t recur. The client thanked us directly to leadership.” |

### 3. What is your greatest success? 
- Achievement, Innovation & Impact 
- Execution, pride, initiative 
- Specific accomplishment → why it mattered → outcome 
- Vague impact, over-crediting self 

 ✅ Example: “I led a zero-downtime migration for a live payment system under high risk, 
resulting in 100% success and no user complaints.” 


### 4.  Worked on something without waiting for your manager’s go-ahead? What made you decide?
- C - Ownership / Initiative
- T - Proactiveness, judgment, leadership at all levels
- A - Focus on a low-risk, high-reward situation, was the right move? Highlight communication afterward.
- R - Sounding rebellious or overly casual
